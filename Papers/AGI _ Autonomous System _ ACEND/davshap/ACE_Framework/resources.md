## Cognition, Psychology, Neuroscience

- A THOUSAND BRAINS, Jeff Hawkins
  - Proposes that human brains are a symphony of repeating circuits that arrive at consensus through a voting mechanism, a la a "mixture of experts" model like we see in LLMs today
- ON TASK, David Badre
  - Deep dive into human focus, cognitive control, and task prosecution. How do we follow goals to completion?
- PHANTOMS IN THE BRAIN, VS Ramachandran
  - Examples of neurological disorders and brain injuries. Brain dysfunctions are very informative for how the brain works.
- NEUROSCIENCE FOR DUMMIES
  - Provides a good survey on the entire nervous system
- BRAINTRUST, Patricia Churchland
  - Synthesis of neuroscience and philosophy. Unpacks morality and ethics through the lens of neuroscience and evolution, starting from the cellular level up through the species level.

## Concepts and Frameworks

- MASLOW'S HIERARCHY OF NEEDS
  - Objective framework detailing what all humans need, and their general priority
- SELF-DETERMINATION THEORY
  - Simple framework for understanding primary human psychology motivations
- GLASSER'S CHOICE THEORY
  - Another simple framework, similar to both of the above.
- KOHLBERG'S THEORY OF MORAL DEVELOPMENT
  - Scientifically objective look at the acquisition and development of morality in humans. E.g. morality emerges from lived experience.
- KEGAN'S THEORY OF COGNITIVE DEVELOPMENT
  - A similar theory to Kohlberg's, but focused on cognitive development rather than simply morality.
- BLOOMS'S TAXONOMY
  - A framework for education, one of the most useful frameworks for understanding intelligence in terms of functional utility and practical application.
- OSI MODEL
  - A layered, abstraction model that underpins all of computer networking today
- DEFENSE IN DEPTH
  - A layered, nested model of cybersecurity
