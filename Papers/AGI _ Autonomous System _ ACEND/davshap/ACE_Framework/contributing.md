# Contributing to ACE_Framework

I greatly appreciate interest in contributing to the ACE Framework! While I am not able to accept unsolicited pull requests at this time, I welcome good faith issues and discussions about the framework and its concepts. 

To maintain a constructive environment, any trolling, harassment, or overtly negative commentary will result in bans. I aim to foster positive collaboration. For more information on the Collaborative Culture Community Policy, see this: https://github.com/daveshap/C3P0

## Discord/Patreon Community

A secondary way to get involved with ACE and even collaborate is to sign up on my Patreon. All tiers will get you acess to my exclusive Discord community where you can connect with plenty of likeminded individuals. I've got dedicated channels AI, ACE, and projects. https://www.patreon.com/daveshap

## ACE Scrum Team

### UPDATE: Team filled

Stay tuned! Once the initial team is setup and running, we may expand to have specific project teams. 

~~Currently, I am looking for 1-2 talented individuals to join the ACE Framework team for 3-6 weeks to help build out a functioning prototype implementation. Ideal candidates have:~~

- ~~Extensive experience working with large language models like GPT~~
- ~~Background in software development, game development, workflow automation, or related fields~~
- ~~At least 10 hours per week of availability for collaboration~~

~~If you meet these criteria and are interested in contributing your skills to advance the ACE Framework, please reach out! I'm excited to explore how we might work together. LinkedIn is the best place to reach out. Please include a reference to the ACE Framework in your message or connection request: https://www.linkedin.com/in/dave-shap-automator/~~

~~Beyond this focused short-term need, I may expand the core team in the future as capacity allows. So please feel free to open issues or start respectful discussions around the ACE Framework concepts. Community engagement helps strengthen this research.~~

~~I appreciate everyone's interest and will do my best to respond to substantive feedback. My goal is to build an open, welcoming community advancing AI safety.~~
